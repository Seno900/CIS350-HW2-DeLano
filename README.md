## Cody DeLano
* I enjoy gardening, although I don't get to do it as often as I want nowadays.
* Reading is another fun hobby, usually smaller texts though.
* I play a variety of games, but lately I've been occupied with Xenoblade 3 and Door Kickers 2.
* I cook as both a hobby and necessity. Not skilled with baking though.
* Unfortunately I am into politics, send help.
